### LoadLog Module 

***

A command line, menu-driven app for searching Windows Event Logs.

***

* LoadLog.psm1 - This module contains the app's command line menu and log querying capability. Must be run as an administrator on the system to query certain system logs such as the "Security" log.

* ldl.ps1 - Experimental script with no useful functionality.

* cpmod.ps1 - Script to install/copy the module to its own module folder.  This would be C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\Modules\LoadLog for system-wide use.  The script assumes a "LoadLog" directory has already been created in this location.
